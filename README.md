# The Scene

**The Scene** is a social discovery app that helps people decide where to go out by surfacing the places people actually go — not just what’s trending. It combines community curation, maps, and lightweight social context to make choosing a night out easier and more intentional.

> Built for cities. Designed for real nights out.

## ✨ What The Scene Does

- **Discover where people go out**  
  Find bars, rooftops, and clubs people actually frequent — not generic lists.

- **Track your nights out**  
  Keep ranked lists and maps of places you’ve been and want to try.

- **Personalized recommendations**  
  Filter out places you don’t want (e.g. nightclubs, standing-only bars) so recommendations fit your preferences.

- **Clean, guided onboarding**  
  A simple signup flow that quickly learns what to recommend — without overwhelming users.
